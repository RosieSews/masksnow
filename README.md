# MasksNOW.org

## Mission

MasksNOW.org is an grassroots volunteer organization with an aim of connecting makers across the country with healthcare organizations in need of masks and other Personal Protective Equipment as they deal with the COVID-19 outbreak.

## Strategy

We are employing technology to give tools to organize, empower and inform local groups to fill the needs in their communities. Our main tool for organizing our volunteers and connecting them with healthcare providers is Airtable. We are also using a gatsbyjs powered website to disseminate information, SendGrid and Freshdesk to manage email and social media communication.
how's that?

## More Details

1. This site is built with Gatsby.js, React, Styled-Components.
2. If you're looking for small things to work on and know Gatsby.js well - feel free to submit PRs.

## How-to's

### contribute

1. Make a local copy by running `git clone https://github.com/RosieSews/masksnow.git`
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies locally
3. Install `gatsby-cli` with `yarn global add gatsby-cli`
4. Create a new branch with a description of your feature `git checkout -b FEATURE` - ex. `git checkout -b make-images-responsive`
5. Work your magic
6. Add any new files, make your commits, and submit a PR. If you run `git push` your terminal should give you directions that look something like `git push --set-upstream origin FEATURE`. Run that code.
7. Go to the repo. You should see a banner with a green button that says Compare & Pull Request. Click the button and finish submitting your PR.

### run a local dev environment

You can go a long way in just copying what's already here - but taking a minute to read some of Gatsby.js' docs will help a lot.
The quick and dirty to get this up and running is:

1. install and run `yarn`
2. install `gatsby-cli` globally: `yarn global add gatsby-cli`.
3. Run `yarn start` to spin up a dev environment
