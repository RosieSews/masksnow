Download Created for Crisis 3-Layer Mask Pattern Packet which includes instructions, pattern, tips, materials guide, process guide and packing sheet.

We are in discussions to partner with the CDC for the 3-Layer Mask pattern. This pattern requires the use of a midweight/lightweight non-woven polyester material, for example:

* Pellon 830 Easy Pattern
* Pellon 40 Midweight Stabilizer
* Pellon 30 Lightweight Stabilizer
* Pellon 810

If you do not have access to this material, you may use the Pocket pattern as a backup.
