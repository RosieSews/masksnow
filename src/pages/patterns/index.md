Download Created for Crisis 3-Layer Mask Pattern Packet which includes instructions, pattern, tips, materials guide, process guide and packing sheet.

We are in discussions to partner with the CDC for the 3-Layer Mask pattern. This pattern requires the use of a midweight/lightweight non-woven polyester material, for example:

* Pellon 830 Easy Pattern
* Pellon 40 Midweight Stabilizer
* Pellon 30 Lightweight Stabilizer
* Pellon 810

If you do not have access to this material, you may use the [Pocket pattern](https://masksnow.org/docs/CFC_Pocket_Mask_3_28.pdf) as a backup.

Smaller sizes coming soon.
