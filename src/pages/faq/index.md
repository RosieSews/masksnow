## Why are you making homemade masks?

Over 220 hospitals in 39 states are requesting handsewn mask donations to battle the shortage caused by the coronavirus crisis. 

## Are homemade masks effective?

Yes. A [Cambridge University study](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6818856-Testing-the-Efficacy-of-Homemade-Masks-2013.html#pages) found in 2013 that cotton-blend masks are 80% as effective at filtration as a surgical mask, and appropriate for emergency use during an influenza pandemic. 100% cotton and other materials are also acceptable.

## Who needs a mask during the coronavirus pandemic?

Everyone can benefit from using a face mask to reduce the likelihood of direct transmission.

## Is it okay to use a hand sewn mask?

The FDA recently issued emergency regulations of its [enforcement policy](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/enforcement-policy-face-masks-and-respirators-during-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-public-health) for masks. Our masks are not considered medical purpose masks under their guidelines because they are not labeled or otherwise intended for use by a health care professional; 2) they are not labeled or otherwise for use in a healthcare facility or environment; and 3) they do not include any drugs, biologics, or anti-microbial/anti-viral agents.

## Can a doctor or nurse use these masks?

The FDA recognizes that, when alternatives, such as FDA-cleared masks or respirators, are unavailable, individuals, including healthcare professionals, might improvise personal protective equipment (PPE). FDA does not intend to object to individuals’ distribution and use of improvised PPE when no alternatives, such as FDA-cleared masks or respirators, are available. 

In response to the respirator shortage crisis due to COVID-19, the CDC [has indicated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy/crisis-alternate-strategies.html) that "it may be necessary for healthcare professionals to use masks that have never been evaluated or approved by NIOSH (including homemade masks).  It may be considered to use these masks for care of patients with COVID-19, tuberculosis, measles, and varicella. However, caution should be exercised when considering this option."

## How many volunteers do you have?

As of today we have over 2,200 volunteers spread amongst every state plus DC and Puerto Rico.

## How many organizers are there in The Masks Now Coalition?

We have 19 national organizers and 49 leads in 35 states, but we’re always looking for more state and regional organizers, in addition to people who can sew a pretty awesome mask.

## Are these masks made for children?

No.

## Who should request face masks from our volunteers?

Any healthcare facility that has patients, support staff, or visitors who would like more protection than being without a face mask. That includes dentists, veterinarians, nursing homes, clinics, and even hospitals may requisition mask donations aware of the above caveats.

## How many hospitals are asking for hand sewn masks?

Over 220 hospitals in 39 states have asked for handsewn masks to supplement their complement of surgical masks and N95 respirators. That’s because every mask we donate for non-clinical use frees up a manufactured mask for a doctor or nurse.

## How many masks should I make and how do I get them to the right place?

After [signing up as a volunteer](http://masksnow.org/volunteer), your state lead will reach out to you by email. Your state lead will have a list of facilities that need face masks and the amount requested. You can either ship the masks, drop them off, or, if there are distribution volunteers in your area, they can be picked up from your home.

## I don't know how to sew, how can I help?

We also have a need for volunteers to make phone calls and distribute masks. We can also accept fabric or mask making kits as long as the fabric is cotton blend or 100% cotton. To do so, please [sign up as a volunteer](http://masksnow.org/volunteer). If you are interested in volunteering behind-the-scenes, please send an email with your interests and skill set to: [volunteer@masksnow.org](mailto:volunteer@masksnow.org)

## What will you do if someone donates a mask that doesn't fit the official pattern?

We donate all masks that we receive. We won't exclude masks that do not strictly follow the the pattern instructions. **The checklist allows for a sewist to mark "other" to indicate that it does not follow the guidelines of the pattern that we disseminate.** That way, the organization receiving the mask will use the mask in whatever context they feel appropriate knowing that it doesn't conform to our specifications, but it may still be useful for their purposes.
