title: What is The Masks Now Coalition?
---
The Masks Now Coalition is a grassroots movement of volunteers and their groups, led by nineteen organizers directing over 1,000 volunteers who banded together in response to the urgent national shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) brought on by the novel coronavirus outbreak in America.

We’ve got volunteers in every state, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico ready to answer the call from over 125 hospitals in 28 states which have made public appeals for homesewn masks.

In an effort to help curb medical supply shortages as we battle COVID-19, we are requesting sewists to make masks and other supplies for use by patients, healthcare workers, at-risk community members, and essential workers, including postal workers, grocery store workers, manufacturing personnel, and more.

We are saddened to report that many medical personnel are already experiencing shortages so severe they are turning to the community to help make masks. But every single mask we produce frees up a manufactured mask for clinical use.

In fact, the Center for Disease Control says that homemade masks may be considered as a last resort because they’re “better than no protection.” The Food & Drug Administration has provided emergency guidance to enable groups like ours which are not making medical masks to expand the number of face masks available.

That’s why we’re looking for volunteers to sew masks and handle the logistics of distribution in every state, DC, and Puerto Rico.
