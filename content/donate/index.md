### Created For Crisis no longer needs to look for ways to help; they come to us.

We already received requests for more designs, ranging from surgical
caps to nasal swabs, and for assistance in other countries. But we
need help. We can find the people, but rapid research and working with
international health authorities require resources we currently lack.


COVID-19 is changing the landscape of healthcare, breaking down
barriers which kept innovators out. This is a new wave of crisis
response, one which empowers people to help through accessible designs
which can be rapidly deployed. Through funding and institutional
support you can help Created for Crisis grow as a grassroots aid
organization, a rapid response team with the diversity and reach of
the internet which provides solutions at a pace with which traditional
avenues cannot compete.
