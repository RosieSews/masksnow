Dear Citizens,

We need your help if you want to go back to work, reopen schools, and bring life back to normal. We need everyone to wear masks now to fight the spread of the coronavirus.

Wearing cloth face masks in public is important medical advice for you and for every person, so we can all join the fight against a deadly pandemic that has paralyzed our country.

Wearing masks is the right thing to do from a medical perspective.

It’s also the right thing to do from an economic perspective because it will greatly expand the number of businesses that could potentially reopen and shorten the waiting period for them to bring people back to work.

The new medical advice in the war against COVID19 is to always wear face masks in public. It comes directly from America’s top minds in public health.

As your doctors, your nurses, and your health administrators, we want to relay this advice to you, our friends, our neighbors, and our patients; mask-wearing is beneficial and necessary.

If you’re walking in the park or down a sidewalk; going to the store, the office, or a meeting, you’ll need to wear a mask.

We do this for each other.

That’s because the effectiveness of mask-wearing rises when the entire community gets involved.

The health of our nation’s citizens and the strength of our economy is in dire jeopardy and wearing masks now is the most important thing we can do to preserve our way of life.

Research is ongoing as to mask effectiveness, but we now know that if everyone wears a mask out of the home in addition to hand washing and physical distancing measures, we can decrease the transmission of the deadly COVID disease.

Wearing masks worked in South Korea, a country with whom America shares deep commercial and cultural ties.

Wearing masks now is the good, right, and the American thing to do to save lives and get back to work.

Please wear masks whenever you leave your home.

Sincerely,

The MasksNow Coalition Medical Advisory Board
